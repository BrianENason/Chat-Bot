# Chat-Bot
Chat-bot for AI

Introduction:
This project required me to create a “chatbot” for a fictional University to assist the students with making career choices based on their Computer Science degree as well as their particular talents and strengths. Through a series of calculated question, Alan (the chatbot) will “learn” which of 5 computer-science related jobs they would be best fit/most interested in.
This writeup will take each requirement section-by-section and break down all the pertinent information. Most of the time the Chatbot will be referred to as Alan, but occasionally where clarity is paramount, it will be referred to as “chatbot” or “the chatbot”.

A.  Explain the functionalities of the chatbot and how they will meet the needs described in the scenario.

In the given scenario, it is stated that the needs of the chatbot are, as follows:
1)	“Work with students to help them identify jobs in computing fields for which they are qualified.”
2)	“Identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in computer science and construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment.”
3)	“The chatbot will interact with individual students, help them identify their strengths and preferences, and help them decide which career option to consider.”
The Chatbot has several key functionalities that help it achieve these goals:
1)	The user says a greeting to Alan (the chatbot), and he will respond in kind with either a variation on “good morning”, “good afternoon”, and “good evening” (depending on the user’s input), or a simple hello message. For example, if the user says “Good Morning”, then Alan will respond in kind with “Good Morning…”.
2)	Alan will then present the first selection of paths: Hardware, or Software. Each subsequent question will be based on button presses to avoid the student having to type and the inevitable typing errors that might cause frustration for the user. However, if the user really wishes to type, it will also respond to the user typing out the answer option that best fits them.
3)	Depending on the user’s answers, Alan will ask either 3 or 4 questions total, and from the user’s answers, Alan will generate one of the 5 suggested jobs (outlined in the next section).
4)	When the user has clicked through the job presented and read the information, Alan will provide the user with the option to start over, explore all (5) jobs Alan knows about, or quit.
5)	Finally, before Alan says goodbye, he asks the user to rate the experience. This rating will be stored in his logs and can be used to improve the user experience. 

How to install Alan:
1)	Download the zip file containing his brain called “Alan Chatbot.zip”
2)	Extract all files from the zip into a folder you can easily find.
3)	Login/create account for “http://www.Pandorabots.com”
4)	Select “Go To Dash” in the upper-right corner of the Pandorabots homescreen
5)	Select the “+” sign to the right of the “MY BOTS” section of the page (left-side)
6)	Give your bot the new name “alan” – lowercase letters only
7)	Keep the “content” selector as a “Blank Bot”
8)	Click “Create Bot”
9)	Look at the “MY BOTS” section on the left side of the screen, locate “alan”. Click on his name, then go to “Edit” -> “Code Editor”.
10)	Inside the code editor, select “File”, “Upload”, and then locate the unzipped “Alan Chatbot” file folder from the “select file” option.
11)	Upload the folder to the chatbot, overwrite any conflicting existing files, and you are done. You can then start to interact with Alan using the editor chat environment, or deploy him for the world to use.
